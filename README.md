### Learning Temple

As I love the process to learn and what comes with, I am also aware that you simply can’t retain every information. I am making this repository, the anchor of my programming skills and knowledge. What I have written is what I truly know and can change over time if I learn a lot more in this domain or if the information is false. 
If you are scrolling through the repo (because why not ? Everyone wants to know the life of others), you have to understand that _it is more of a messy black board where I write my ideas and stuff_, than _concise_, _veracious_ information.

**Never stop learning !**
